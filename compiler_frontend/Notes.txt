It turns out that some types of invalid syntax (e.g. "naked" let/do/while/etc.
statements in class scope) can lead to infinite loops in the compiler. This
should probably be addressed, but requires more sophistication than is strictly
required by the book's spec.

There is some kind of issue with a certain set of comments in one of the test
examples (the Ch. 11 "Seven" folder, in Main.jack) - this needs to be fixed,
but for now just want to get moving forward.
