# NAND2Tetris Implementation

This is an implementation of the assembler and compiler system described in the [NAND2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org). The assembler produces machine code according to the Hack architecture specification, and the compiler translates code in the Jack language to run on this virtual machine architecture.
